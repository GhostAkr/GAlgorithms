# GAlgorithms

## Brief repo description
Here are some useful algorithms implemented in different programming languages. These algorithms are implemented for fun and are not pretended to be 100% effcient and correct.

## Repo contents
- ``file_max_word`` — algorithm searching for the longest word in a text file (implemented in Python);
- ``inverse_matr`` — set of algorihtms calculating inverse matrices:
  - ``ExplicitInverse3x3.jl`` — calculation of inverse 3x3 matrix via hardcoded formulas;
- ``merge_sort.py`` — 'Merge' sort implemented in Python;
- ``quick_sort.py`` — 'Quick' sort implemented in Python.
